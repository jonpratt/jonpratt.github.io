Sure, "theres an app for that" to use WordPress, or Weebly, or whatever to manage web content from an iOS device. But what about lifting the hood and tinkering with the engine? These solutions don't get us there. Recently I've discovered the "everything-old-is-new-again" concept of static web sites, and had an "Aha!" moment when I learned about GitHub pages and Git2Go. Here's a real opportunity to play with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

And as I'm poking around more in GitHub Pages, I'm learning about this [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) environment that provides a middle ground between pure HTML/CSS/JS and the database-driven content management platforms like WordPress. Which then gives me an excuse to play with "Markdown" and all kinds of other interesting stuff. YAML? Sure!
